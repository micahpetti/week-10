week 10 note

Images overlap to create a 3D model.

First you must grab the images- Import images and create directory

AND a base URL pattern: the fundamental, consistent part of a web address, like the "root" for all other parts of a site or API

downlaod the images- let machine know the rage of images 

Thhe images must have connection points- extract features+ convert to grayscale

displaying SIFT features, fewer things are highlighted the ORB features many circles around the tree the person and the windows of the building

The similar points between the images can then be connected- lines are drawn between features that are identified as matching... some are less accurate and match parts that appear similar but are not the same point. 

then it has to be situated in a matrix that gives the camera or viewer a position 

only new matches should be made as new data points

This creates a structure like a wire web for a textrure (the image) to be draped on

Closely Observed Layers: Storytelling and the Heart in Kisha Supernant

Slow archaeology is the process of paying attention to the processes that make up the end product 

Zen excavation- slowed down process that does not look for solutions to roadblocks

process of presenting information in diagrams can take heartfelt angles 

Choice to name the artifacts (people) found is a process of humanization and narrativisation
