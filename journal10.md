Week 10 reflection 

seeing them as people rather than as skeletons gives us a sense of who they might
have been, young or old, male or female. The reconstructions help us see the people
who in death, and perhaps in life, were directly linked to Building 3

this section of the heartfelt archaeology paper stuck out to me. Like Klara said in her note the illustration of the skeltons found imagined as humans made me pause. It is interesting how much of an impact choosing to humanize the individuals found visually has. 

THe creative mindset proposed in the other materials is so intersting! Theres an exhibit at CUAG at the moment created by two sight impared artists that is based on a tactile narritive of a fictional-futuristic archaeological site. The exhibit is delightfully tactile and I felt like it was very impactful for me to see it. I had the pleasure to interview both of the artists for a radio broadcast and in our conversation we discussed the recreation of experience through art, and how that differs throughout the ability spectrum, and how when those who are aligned with non-normative sensory abilities consider their own experiences- the form, function and ethos of a gallery is blown open. 

I found this convorsation applicable to this weeks theme of creative archaeology. Much like the ideas that surround a gallery are dismantled by complicating the narritive of form, so are ideas around archaeology.
